# Google Apps Script Webpack Typescript Boilerplate
#### That's a mouthful, huh?

This is a boilerplate for using TypeScript in Google Apps Script. Pretty self explanatory.

## Downloading
In a shell with rsync installed, run
```sh
rsync -rlp --exclude '.git' git@github.com:/coolreader18/google-apps-script-webpack-typescript-boilerplate YOUR_PROJECT
```
Or, if you don't have that, just `git clone` as usual or download the zip from github.

## Configuring
All that's needed to get up and running with pushing to GAS is to put your script ID into the [.env](.env) file and sign into
Clasp ([repo](https://github.com/google/clasp)).
